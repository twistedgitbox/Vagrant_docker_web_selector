# Use this file to list the gitrepos you want have placed in the guest
#
# Place WEB or DOCKER after the URL in order to notify the program:
# 1. WEB - Place the files at /vagrant/web so the NGINX can serve them
# 2. DOCKER - Place the files at /vagrant/docker and run the docker-compose in the same directory. This will create, load and run the docker container you have indicated.
#
# Designating more than one WEB or DOCKER URL will result in the last selection of each category being chosen.
#
# The URL must include http:// using just www.websitename.com will be ingnored.
# The URL must also end with .git. Using the URL without ending will be ignored.
# The URL format should be https://gitsite.com/username/projectname.git
#
# Since this selects git repos, obviously the URL needs to be a real git repo. It will filter out text that is not a website and but imaginary git repos will probably cause a problem. Try to use real URLs?
